This is the folder for files relating to the Palomar AO imaging of HAT-P-20 in JHK. [Ngo+2015 also imaged the system in H and Ks.]https://github.com/TGBeatty/NRC33/blob/main/HATP20_AO_Results/Ngo2015.pdf) Note that Ngo+2015 gets an unphysical measurements of H-Ks, but does recover reasonable stellar parameters.

# SED fitting results

**HAT-P-14A:**
- Teff = 6610 +/- 100K
- Rstar = 1.65 +/- 0.03 Rsun
- Mstar = 1.60 +/- 0.18 Msun

**HAT-P-14B:**
- Teff = 3475 +/- 200K
- Rstar = 0.29 +/- 0.03 Rsun

One thing I haven't done yet is deblended the existing transit depth measurements to get a more accurate value for Rp/Rs given the existence of -14B. Ignoring that deblending (which should be a few percent effect), I get the following for the planet:

**HAT-P-14Ab:**
- Rp = 1.29 +/- 0.03 RJ
- Mp = 2.6 +/- 0.3 MJ
